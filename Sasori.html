    <h2>About Sasori</h2>
    <p>
      Sasori, known as the "Red Sand," was a former ninja from the Hidden Sand Village and a member of the Akatsuki. Sasori was a master of puppetry and is renowned for creating human puppets, which are his specialty. 
      He transformed his own body into a human puppet, abandoning his human form for a more efficient, mechanical one. Sasori's ultimate creation was his grandmother, Chiyo, who he transformed into a puppet as well.
      He was an expert in poisons and deadly traps, making him one of the most dangerous members of the Akatsuki.
