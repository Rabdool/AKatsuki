    <h2>About Tobi</h2>
    <p>
      Tobi, also known as Obito Uchiha, is one of the most complex and influential characters in the Naruto series. Initially introduced as a goofy, bumbling member of the Akatsuki, Tobi's true identity is revealed to be Obito Uchiha, the last surviving member of the Uchiha clan.
      He plays a significant role as the leader behind the Akatsuki's grand plan to control the world. Obito's tragic past, which includes the death of his love Rin and the manipulation by Madara Uchiha, leads him to embrace a dark path in pursuit of the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
      Tobi's abilities include the use of the Sharingan, Kamui, and the Rinnegan, making him one of the most formidable members of the Akatsuki.
