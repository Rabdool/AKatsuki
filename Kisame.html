    <h2>About Kisame</h2>
    <p>
      Kisame Hoshigaki, often referred to as the "Tailed Beast without a tail," is a former member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist and a high-ranking member of Akatsuki. 
      Known for his monstrous sword, Samehada, Kisame was feared for his ability to absorb chakra and unleash devastating attacks in combat. 
      He formed a partnership with Itachi Uchiha within the Akatsuki, and they were tasked with hunting down the Tailed Beasts. 
      Despite his fearsome persona, Kisame had a complex personality, showcasing loyalty to the organization and a deep understanding of the worldâ€™s darker sides.
