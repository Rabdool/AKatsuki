    <h2>About Itachi</h2>
    <p>
      Itachi Uchiha was a prodigy of the Uchiha clan, known for his brilliance and power from a young age. 
      He joined the Akatsuki after tragically annihilating his own clan, a mission he accepted to prevent a civil war. 
      Despite his dark reputation, Itachi's actions were driven by love for his younger brother Sasuke and a desire for peace.
