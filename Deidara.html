        <h2>About Deidara</h2>
        <p>
            Deidara was an explosives expert from Iwagakure who joined Akatsuki and partnered with Sasori. 
            He used explosive clay sculptures created with mouths in his hands and had a strong belief in art as a momentary explosion. 
            Known for shouting "Art is an explosion!", Deidara was both eccentric and deadly.
