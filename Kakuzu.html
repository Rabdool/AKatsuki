    <h2>About Kakuzu</h2>
    <p>
      Kakuzu was a bounty-hunting shinobi from Takigakure who joined the Akatsuki for financial gain. 
      Known for his greed and immortality-like abilities, he extended his life by stealing hearts from his victims. 
      His body was stitched together with threads, allowing him to detach and reattach limbs and control his enemies' bodies.
      He was partnered with Hidan, forming one of Akatsuki's most dangerous duos.
