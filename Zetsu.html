    <h2>About Zetsu</h2>
    <p>
      Zetsu is one of the most enigmatic members of the Akatsuki, known for his dual personality and his unique appearance. He is a combination of two personalities: Black Zetsu and White Zetsu. 
      Black Zetsu is a manifestation of Kaguya Ootsutsuki's will and has a complex agenda involving the manipulation of key events in the story. 
      White Zetsu, on the other hand, is a plant-based organism with the ability to regenerate and is known for being highly skilled in tracking and spying. 
      Zetsu is often seen as a scout or intelligence gatherer for the organization.
