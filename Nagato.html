    <h2>About Nagato</h2>
    <p>
      Nagato, also known as Pain, is one of the most powerful figures in the Akatsuki. Originally from the Hidden Rain village, Nagato was a victim of war and tragedy from a young age, which ultimately led him to follow the path of the Akatsuki's ideology. 
      As the leader of the organization, he possesses the Rinnegan, a legendary dōjutsu that grants him six distinct powers, including the ability to control the Six Paths of Pain — six bodies that act as his extensions.
      Nagato's ultimate goal was to bring peace to the world by controlling and ending all war, although his methods were controversial and destructive.
